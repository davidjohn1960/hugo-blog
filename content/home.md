# HOME PAGE
***
This is going to be my home page where I will put some introductor text about myself and what this website is all about.
I might even add some photos in here as well. I will have to wait and see, as I need to learn about Hugo and how to set things up. This is not urgent at the moment as I need it later once I am retired, but I would like to get everything ready fore then.

Mi esperas, ke eblas havi tiun ĉi retpagojn multlingve. Necesas, ke mi relernu la Esperanton kaj daŭre learnu la Irelandan Lingvon.

Here should go some text in Geailge.

David John Hulatt, BSc.

P.S. for testing GitHub intergration with Kate Editor
